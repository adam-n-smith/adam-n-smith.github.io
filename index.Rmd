I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk) in London, UK. In my research, I work on large-scale measurement problems in the areas of pricing, market definition, and personalization. I am also interested in Bayesian methods and computational topics related to hierarchical modeling, shrinkage estimation, and nonparametrics. I hold a BA in Economics, MS in Statistics, and PhD in Marketing from The Ohio State University.
