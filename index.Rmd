I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk) in London, England.

My research lies at the intersection of Marketing, Economics, and Statistics. I enjoy developing micro-econometric methods that can be used to inform managerial decisions in the areas of retail pricing, market definition, and target marketing. My current research projects focus on estimating large-scale demand models, designing and evaluating personalized pricing policies, and measuring the value of customer data and flexible predictive models.
